### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 1)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 70: 3 August 2020 , Monday

**Today's Progress**: Practiced some competitive programming questions in Java.

**Thoughts**: Focusing on algorithms and which data structure is required for its best implementation

### Day 71: 4 August 2020 , Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Started practising recursion programs using Java.

**Thoughts**: Recursive function is a function that calls itself to solve a smaller sub-problem of same type. But necessary conditions are it must have a base case along with recursive case.


### Day 72: 5 August 2020 , Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Solved some basic programming questions in Java

**Thoughts**: Revision of basic concepts
